# px4-ros2-drone-control
ROS2 nodes for PX4 drone offboard hover control with arm/disarm and slightly dubious obstacle avoidance features.

# Nodes
- hover.py
  _This node was developed entirely by me during MIT BWSI. It implements offboard hovering for a PX4 drone using ROS2 and allows user input for target waypoints and incorporates arm/disarm capabilities._
  Note: The final version (unfortunately lost) also supported parsing waypoints from a YAML file to allow for path following capabilities
